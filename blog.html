          <h2>CANINE INFLUENZA UPDATE</h2>
          <p class="pb"></p>
          <div class="status-meeting">
            <span>
                The Greater Los Angeles area is currently experiencing an outbreak of Canine Influenza.

                What is Canine Influenza? Canine influenza is a highly contagious virus that causes nasal discharge, coughing, high fever, lethargy, and poor appetite in dogs.  Some dogs may develop severe illness such as pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Though rare, it can cause disease in cats as well.  Currently, canine influenza strains are NOT transmissible to humans.  Most dogs are contagious ~2-5 days BEFORE they show signs of illness.  The virus survives for 1-2 days in the environment and is easily killed with disinfectants such as RESCUE.  The vaccine series consists of two doses given 4 weeks apart.  The vaccine can be given as early as 7 weeks of age.  It is recommended that dogs get the bivalent vaccine which protects against the two most common strains of canine influenza. After the initial series, dogs should receive a booster vaccine every 12 months.

                Can you imagine an America where no pet is killed in a shelter again simply for being unwanted? We can.

              When Best Friends launched the No-Kill Los Angeles (NKLA) initiative in 2012, only 56% of the dogs and cats in the city’s shelters were making it out alive. But thanks to the hard work of so many, including the entire NKLA Coalition, Mayor Garcetti, Los Angeles Animal Services, our fabulous local community and devoted volunteers, we are thrilled to announce a sustained save rate of 90.49% for 2020.
Join us. Together, we can Save Them All®.
